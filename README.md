# Shark-Tracker-Pro

## Project Requirements

With your group, you’ll again conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating your first collaborative MERN-stack single-page application, you’ll combine a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. You’ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies you’ve used throughout this course. These include storing your project code in GitHub, managing your work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

For this project, you should start from scratch. Doing so will allow you to revisit your front-end abilities in the context of React and solidify your understanding of working with multiple servers in a MERN application. Your skills have continued to improve since the first two projects, so naturally your approach will be different considering the experience you’ve gained with each new application you’ve built.

## User Story

As a group, we wanted to build an app that connects people with real-time information about sharks and their movements. By creating an engaging platform with interactive features, we aimed to educate users and highlight the importance of shark conservation.

## Features

Our project used multiple features, consisting of React.js, CSS, APollo client, Geocoding API, Express.js, JWT, GraphQL, and MongoDB.
